                    Welcome to <span class="text-orange-500 font-bold">Trisara</span>, where we bring the essence of everyday cooking into your home with warmth and
                    simplicity. Inspired by the Sanskrit term meaning 'Third Garden in Heaven,' our brand is dedicated
                    to creating kitchenware that is accessible, reliable, and affordable, designed specifically to meet
                    your daily needs.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-orange-500 mt-12 mb-4">The Beginning</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-black mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Trisara was founded with a straightforward idea to provide quality kitchenware at prices that are
                    affordable for all. We noticed that many kitchen products are out of reach for those setting up
                    their first home, whether students, young professionals, or families on a budget. Our goal is to
                    fill that gap by offering practical and cost-effective kitchen essentials that don't compromise on
                    performance.
